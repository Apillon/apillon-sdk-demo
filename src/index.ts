Hello developer

We have prepared multiple script for you to run so you can see Apillon SDK in action.
This are code snippets of some of the main functionalities of SDK. 
You will need to set different ENV variables to run the full set of examples. Some can be run without 
any ENV some need them. You can read more of that from README.
If you are running in codesandbox be careful of exposing the keys.

We have all major functionalities as examples so you can run scripts:
- npm run storage:buckets
- npm run storage:bucket-content
- npm run storage:bucket-upload
- npm run storage:bucket-upload-from-folder
- npm run storage:bucket-ipns-create
- npm run storage:bucket-ipns-publish

- npm run hosting:websites
- npm run hosting:website-deploy
- npm run hosting:website-deploy-status
